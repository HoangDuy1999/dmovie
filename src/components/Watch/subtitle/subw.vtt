00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.000
Everyone wants the most from life111

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Like internet experiences that are rich1111 <b>and</b> entertaining

3
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.900
Then one day.
for reasons beyond my control.

4
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.610
I was repeatedly crushed...

5
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.780
over and over by the cruel
cervix of my mother. Leslie.

6
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.160
I put up a good fight. but I lost.

7
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.710
for the first time. but not the last.

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.170
I was born three days after 9/11.

9
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.420
I can hear you. I can hear you.
the rest of the world hears you.

10
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.260
and the people who knocked
these buildings down

11
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.850
will hear all of us soon.

12
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.730
USA. USA! USA. USA!

13
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.940
My mother and father spent two days
in the hospital.

14
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.860
holding me under the soft glow
of the television.

15
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.690
watching those towers fall
over and over again.

16
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.990
until the feelings of grief
gave way to numbness.

17
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.990
And then. without warning.

18
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.370
a middle-class childhood
in an American suburb.

19
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.660
Thirteen... fourteen...

20
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.540
fifteen... sixteen...

21
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.340
- What are you looking at. Rue?
- Seventeen...

22
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.050
Rue. look at me.

23
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.260
- One. two. three...
- What are you doing. Rue?

24
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.020
I'd say she's suffering
from obsessive compulsive disorder...

25
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.690
It's not like I was physically abused...

26
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.270
...attention deficit disorder...

27
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.940
- ...or had a shortage of clean water...
- ...general anxiety disorder...

28
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.530
...or was molested by a family member.

29
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.530
...and possibly bipolar disorder.
But she's a little young to tell.

30
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.070
So. explain this shit to me.

31
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.080
Honey. it's just the way
your brain was hardwired.

32
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.620
Plenty of great. intelligent. funny.
interesting. and creative people

33
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.330
have struggled with the same things
you struggle with.

34
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.710
Like who?

35
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.260
Vincent Van Gogh.

36
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.970
Sylvia Plath.

37
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.470
And your favorite. Britney Spears.

38
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.640
- She's bald!
- Oh. my God!

39
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.770
She is completely bald.

40
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.730
I don't remember much
between the ages of eight and 12.

41
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.990
Just that the world moved fast
and my brain moved slow.

42
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.160
Does anybody have any idea
of what a preposition might be?

43
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.200
And every now and then. if I focused
too closely on the way I breathed...

44
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.540
...I'd die.

45
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.130
Slow down. just breathe.

46
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.260
Until every second of every day.

47
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.060
you find yourself
trying to outrun your anxiety.

48
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.310
What's wrong. Rue?

49
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.230
And quite frankly...

50
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.020
I'm just fucking exhausted.

51
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.650
You said the doctor was in our network.
How could he suddenly be out of network?

52
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.530
I can't afford it.

53
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.070
Did you see that video
of the beauty queen

54
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.200
who got acid thrown on her face?

55
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.370
- Mm. what? No.
- It's pretty fucked up.

56
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.170
- Hey. Mom. you got any tampons?
- In my bathroom. under the sink.

57
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.170
And at some point. you make a choice
about who you are and what you want.

58
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.640
Oh. my...

59
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.610
All right. Gia. let's roll.

60
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.450
Why is the co-payment $300?

61
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.080
Rue. did you eat breakfast?

62
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.330
- What's with the sunglasses?
- What sunglasses?

63
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.850
I just showed up one day.
without a map or a compass...

64
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.640
Attention. students.
we need to lockdown.

65
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.230
...or to be honest. anyone capable of
giving on iota of good fucking advice.

66
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.150
And I know it all may seem sad.
but guess what?

67
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.490
I didn't build this system.
nor did I fuck it up.

68
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.020
And then it happens. That moment
when your breath starts to slow.

69
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.490
And every time you breathe. you
breathe out all the oxygen you have.

70
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.040
And everything stops:

71
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.250
your heart. your lungs.

72
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.290
then finally. your brain.

73
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.550
And everything you feel. and wish.
and want to forget. it all just sinks.

74
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.180
And then suddenly...

75
00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.280
...you give it air again.
give it life again.

76
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.620
I remember the first time it happened to
me I got so scared I wanted to call 911.

77
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.580
Go to the hospital and be kept alive
by machines and apple juice.

78
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.540
But I didn't want to look like an idiot.

79
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.130
and I didn't want
to fuck up everyone's night.

80
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.180
And then over time. it's all I wanted...

81
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.930
those two seconds of nothingness.

82
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.320
I spent a good portion of the summer
before junior year in rehab.

83
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.030
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change.

84
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.080
the courage to change the things I can.

85
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.370
and the wisdom to know the difference.

86
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.260
Rue!

87
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.850
- Come here!
- Hey.

88
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.480
- How are you?
- Good.

89
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.350
- I missed you.
- I missed you. too.

90
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.610
Look at you. Are you growing? No.

91
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.650
Hey!

92
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.870
I'm very happy for you. Rue.

93
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.880
You're about to start
a brand-new chapter.

94
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.950
It was the end of summer.
the week before school started.

95
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:56.410
I had no intention of staying clean.
And Jules had just moved to town.

96
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.630
There's some new girl in town that
I think you gonna be friends with.

97
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.010
- Who?
- Shit. I don't know.

98
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.260
She came in yesterday
lookin' all Sailor Moon and shit.

99
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:22.350
I'm thinking to myself. like. look like
somebody Rue would get along with.

100
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.230
Which was sort of like
a dead-on observation for Fezco.

101
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.990
who's not normally revolving
in the same direction as planet Earth.

102
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.070
So. how long you been back?

103
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.950
- Five days.
- And like. how are you feeling?

104
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.660
I mean. ever since I gave my life over
to my lord and savior Jesus Christ.

105
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.250
things have been. like. really good.

106
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.620
- Word? That's what's up.
- Yeah.

107
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.960
- I'm fucking with you. It was a joke.
- Shit.

108
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.840
Hey. I don't judge.

109
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.970
- But low-key. is Ashtray in the back?
- Are you serious?

110
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.640
What. you think 'cause I went
to rehab. I stayed clean?

111
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.390
I mean. ain't that the point?

112
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.430
Yeah. well.
the world's coming to an end.

113
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.900
and I haven't even
graduated high school yet.

114
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.030
I thought your ass was dead.

115
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.450
I thought you had Asperger's till
I realized you're just a prick.

116
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.990
This is a fickle industry.
Y'all come and go.

117
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.330
I'm just trying to stack my cash.
pay off our mortgage.

118
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.580
So what the fuck you want?

119
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.090
- You don't want to try nothin' new?
- Like what?

120
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:38.220
2C-T-2. 2C-T-7.
and 5-MeO-DIPT.

121
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.430
I'm sorry. I have zero fucking idea
what you just said.

122
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.770
It doesn't matter.
But this shit is fucking lit.

123
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:49.110
- What is it?
- N-diisopropyl-5-methoxytryptamine.

124
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.150
It's a fast-acting psychedelic.

125
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.780
Got some similarities to LSD.
but with. like. key differences.

126
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.870
Not as visual and shit.
but definitely a sense distorter.

127
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.460
What's wrong?

128
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.210
I'm just so happy.

129
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.420
I don't know.
The shit's been blowing up in Tampa.

130
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.260
and mad people like to fuck on it.

131
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.560
- Okay. Yeah.
- That'll be 120.

132
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.930
- Fez said he'd spot me.
- Fezco don't spot nobody.

133
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.850
Yeah. well. it's a post-rehab discount.
so you should ask him.

134
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.650
I will go ask him.
'cause I know you're full of shit.

135
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.450
In truth. I didn't have much of an issue
with Nate

136
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.450
until all the bullshit with Jules.

137
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.120
I mean. I never liked him.
and once. during freshman formal.

138
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.500
he tried to finger me on the dance floor
without my permission.

139
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.800
But like... it's America.

140
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.220
And if they were throwing
an end-of-summer party...

141
00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.550
Yo. I'd do it for Rue!

142
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.100
...of course I'd fucking go.

143
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.100
Yo. The whole world's
gonna be talking about

144
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.230
how McKay threw the grimiest
fucking banger of the summer.

145
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:14.150
I don't know. bro. You know my mom is
real OCD. A little scratch on the wall.

146
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.690
the dishes are out of order.

147
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.990
We'll just take a picture of everything.
We'll put it back the way we found it.

148
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.030
What the fuck is this.
Mission Impossible?

149
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.120
Would you stop worrying
about your mom.

150
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.910
and start worrying
about all the fucking pussy

151
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.790
that we're gonna smash tonight. bro.

152
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.410
No. no. no. no. no. Wait.
Isn't Maddy coming tonight?

153
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.340
I don't know. I don't give a fuck.
She broke up with me. Fuck her.

154
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.300
See. no. bro. 'Cause she's crazy.

155
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.550
I don't want her to come
and try to burn my house down.

156
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.090
- Burn your...
- Yeah.

157
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.180
Shut the fuck up.

158
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.350
Yo. This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

159
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.640
Right here.
I'm gonna tell you something...

160
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.640
- Don't do anything stupid. Come on.
- Yeah. yeah.

161
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:53.400
Hey. yo. what up. B?

162
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.190
Yo. how 'bout you come
and ride on this dick?

163
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.650
No. Nate. chill. bro. Come on man.

164
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.700
Fuck. bro.

165
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.330
Whoops.

166
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:17.510
Jules moved from the city to the suburbs
after her mom and dad got divorced.

167
00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.380
She doesn't really like
to talk about it.

168
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.510
but dads almost never get
full custody.

169
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.350
so you know some shit
definitely went down.

170
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.560
She went to. like. three weeks
of summer school with Kat.

171
00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.690
who failed Intro to Visual Arts.

172
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.050
- Do you think my areolas look weird?
- No.

173
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.140
- But. like. the edges. though.
- Maddy. they're fine.

174
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.930
Fine like they're kind of weird.
or fine like

175
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.010
nobody but me would ever notice
what I notice?

176
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.060
Fine like shut the fuck up. Maddy.

177
00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.100
I'm disgusting.
I literally look disgusting.

178
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.730
Maddy. you just snap the fuck out
of this. You're hot as fuck.

179
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.820
- Nate's a loser. Who cares?
- He's not a loser. He's a dick.

180
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.150
All dicks are losers. Duh.

181
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.820
Look. bottom line:
y'all need to walk into this party

182
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.910
like your pussy costs a million dollars.

183
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.330
For real. I'd settle
for like fifty grand.

184
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.950
Fifty grand is a million dollars.

185
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.670
I'd settle for. like. four Corona Lights
and some non-rapey affection.

186
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.460
- That's kind of depressing.
- Nate's totally ruined my confidence.

187
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.500
You know when somebody
just constantly criticizes.

188
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.130
like. everything about you?

189
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.800
Yep. That's. like. every guy.

190
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.010
You just need to catch a dick
and forget about your troubles.

191
00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.300
Girl. you just need to catch a dick.

192
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.010
Seriously. Maddy. the best thing
to do after a breakup

193
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.970
is to fuck someone new.
and then move on.

194
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.850
Please. Kat. remind me again
how many guys you've fucked?

195
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.230
And. oh. yeah. cat-fishing. that
don't count.

196
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.610
Can you not be a cunt
for like. 15 seconds?

197
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:49.120
Dad. stop being a pervert!
We're literally. like. all naked!

198
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.290
Fuck.

199
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.380
Okay.

200
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.260
- Where were you?
- I went to eat.

201
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.590
- What do you mean. you went to eat?
- What?

202
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.180
What? Don't walk away from me.

203
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.640
- You know what. Rue? I don't trust you.
- I don't know what you want me to say.

204
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.640
I want you to tell me where you were.

205
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.060
- I just said I went to fucking eat!
- Don't you talk to me like that!

206
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.650
You know what?
I'm gonna drug test you.

207
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.900
- Don't be slamming no doors around here.
- It was an accident.

208
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.690
I don't care. You're not leaving this
house until you take a drug test.

209
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.830
- I just peed!
- Slam another door.

210
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.700
That girl's gonna be the death of me.

211
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.630
Shit.

212
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.250
Now. there's a few ways
to beat a drug test.

213
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.800
The first is simple. Stop doing drugs.

214
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.100
But if you're in a bind and totally
fucked. option one: niacin.

215
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:58.640
It's a B vitamin that. like. breaks
down fat and chemicals or whatever.

216
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.440
and if you take a lot of it.
like 2.000 milligrams.

217
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.400
then chug a few gallons of water.

218
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.480
you can flush your system
in two to three days.

219
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.940
The only problem is.
it has a few side effects.

220
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.070
Skin flushing.
extreme dizziness. vomiting.

221
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:13.450
rapid heartbeat.
and sometimes death.

222
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.910
I don't recommend it. Nor does
any legit drug site on the internet.

223
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.170
Option 2: synthetic urine.

224
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.250
Yeah. fucking right.

225
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:27.300
Option 3: get a non-drug
addict friend to piss for you.

226
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.920
The only problem is...

227
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.300
...most over-the-counter
home drug testing kits

228
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.060
come with a heat-sensor strip that
detects the temperature of your urine.

229
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.310
And if your parents watch you pee.
you can't really do the sink trick.

230
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.190
So you gotta get it fresh.

231
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.650
Hey. Rue.

232
00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.610
- Hey. I... I need a favor.
- What?

233
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.910
- I... like for real. Lexi.
- What?

234
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.330
Side effects of this option?

235
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.370
Are you serious?

236
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.000
Please.

237
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.960
Thanks.

238
00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.470
Hey. Rue.

239
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.180
How was rehab?

240
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.180
Shit.

241
00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:25.600
- It was good. It was really good.
- Well. that's good.

242
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:28.270
- How long have you been back?
- Five days.

243
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.030
Oh.

244
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.650
- New chapter.
- Mom.

245
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.860
Hmm?

246
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.530
Lexi and I have known each other
since pre-school.

247
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.200
And like. in some ways
she's my best friend.

248
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.410
even though I think we've grown apart.

249
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.540
We don't really have
much in common anymore.

250
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.260
Did you meet any cute guys there?

251
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.720
- Here's that eyeliner.
- Thanks.

252
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.810
Mom. I have to pee!

253
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.810
I wish we could do this in a way

254
00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.820
that wasn't a complete
invasion of my privacy.

255
00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.360
Well. you lost your right to
privacy after your overdose.

256
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.030
- That was a mistake.
- Don't be flip. Rue.

257
00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.120
Could you... Thank you.

258
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.540
You don't understand.
This was the most frightening moment

259
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.800
a mother could witness. And Gia...

260
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.050
- Gia. who absolutely idolizes you...
- I know. Mom.

261
00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.890
To have her find you unconscious...

262
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.890
Can we just...
Can we not do this right now. Mom?

263
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.610
Rue?

264
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.150
Rue?

265
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.410
Rue.

266
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.800
I know a lot of you probably hate me
right now. and I get it.

267
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.090
If I could be a different person.
I promise you. I would.

268
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.050
Not because I want it.
but because they do.

269
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.600
And therein lies the catch.

270
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:32.570
I'm sorry...
for slamming the door earlier.

271
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.570
It's okay. I forgive you. Come here.

272
00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.000
Hey. Mom?

273
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.040
- Yeah?
- Can I spend the night at Lexi's?

274
00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.000
- Yeah. that's fine.
- Thanks.

275
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.670
Yeah.

276
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:58.110
- Where you going?
- I don't know. Some party. or something.

277
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.530
Or something?

278
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.870
Dad.

279
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.620
I know. You know. just. new town.
Be safe.

280
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.620
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Good.

281
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.580
- Love you.
- I love you. too.

282
00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.670
- Okay.
- Have fun.

283
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.940
Jules told me later what had happened.

284
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.640
Looking back on it.

285
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.270
she probably would have just
been better off going to McKay's.

286
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.690
But...

287
00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.550
Come in.

288
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.360
Yo. so. Cassie's a whore. Fact.

289
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.690
No. she's not. Fact.
She's not even that type of girl.

290
00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.450
Oh. Have you seen
her slut pages. though?

291
00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.530
- No.
- They're wild. yo.

292
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.280
- She's like a fuckin' freak
- Cassie's on the slut pages?

293
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.580
Yo. we gotta see this shit.

294
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.250
Yo. what are y'all even doing
out the room. man?

295
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:17.830
- Go back upstairs. bro.
- What?

296
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.040
- Thing one and thing two. Take it up.
- Oh. yo.

297
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.960
- Take it up.
- Relax. No one gets here till ten.

298
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.380
What's up. Nate? What's good.
what's good. good lookin'.

299
00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.720
Look. all I'm saying is.
I think you did Cassie. That's it.

300
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.640
Whether I like her
or not is irrelevant.

301
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.310
The fact is. she's a fucking whore
through and through. bro.

302
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.890
All right. look. I don't know what
she's done. guys. but I'm just saying.

303
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.190
I think she's cool. She's smart.
She's funny.

304
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:43.730
Bro. she likes cars. man.

305
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.490
She loves cars.
Shit. thank you for telling me.

306
00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.530
- What the fuck?
- Dude's got mad feelings.

307
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.990
For real. yo. McKay's
about to start a Pinterest. guys.

308
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.280
Just wait. Give it a minute.

309
00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:58.290
Yo. did you say you don't know
what she's done?

310
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.750
No. I don't know.

311
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:10.300
Take a seat. You and I are gonna take
a little trip to the land of shame. bro.

312
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.310
Here's the fucking thing that
pisses me off about the world.

313
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.020
Like. every time
someone's shit gets leaked.

314
00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.980
whether it's J. Law or Leslie Jones.

315
00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.070
the whole world's like. "Well
if you don't want it out there.

316
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.690
don't take the nudes
in the first place."

317
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:33.610
I'm sorry. I know your generation relied
on flowers and fathers' permission.

318
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.450
but it's 2019.
and unless you're Amish.

319
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:40.040
nudes are the currency of love.
so stop shaming us.

320
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.420
Shame the assholes who create
password-protected online directories

321
00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.500
of naked. underage girls.

322
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.050
Cassie's actually super sweet.

323
00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.470
You remember. like. from earlier.

324
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.800
- Yo. Rue. Rue.
- Hey. How you been?

325
00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.930
She's just being coy.

326
00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:01.770
'Cause she has a new boyfriend
she's head over heels for.

327
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:04.440
Mom. stop being retarded.
He's not my boyfriend.

328
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.440
Oh. Okay.

329
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.690
Who's that handsome young man
who came over for dinner last night?

330
00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:13.820
- Oh. my God. Mom! Stop!
- Christopher McKay.

331
00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.780
So. you're dating McKay.

332
00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.240
Okay. Mom. I'm literally going
to poison you in your sleep.

333
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.290
So. Rue. how was rehab?

334
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.960
Did you meet any cute guys there?

335
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.210
- Here's that eyeliner.
- Thanks.

336
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.010
But anyway. back to this bullshit.

337
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.970
And the Oscar goes to...

338
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.390
- Oh!
- Shit!

339
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:41.600
I'm talkin' 'bout. like. tag team.

340
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.440
- That's what I'm saying. Double team.
- Like. triple.

341
00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.560
- With Roy in the front.
- You can't tell that that's her. man.

342
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:50.190
- It's her. bro.
- This is her. Look at her titties.

343
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.490
You want my advice?
You fuck her like the whore she is.

344
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.150
you kick her ass to the curb.

345
00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.910
If you don't. we will.

346
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.910
Shut your all little virgin asses
up. man.

347
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.580
Y'all wouldn't even know
what to do with that.

348
00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.960
Are you crazy?
I just got a tutorial. step-by-step.

349
00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.000
It's obvious
that Nate got in McKay's head.

350
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.300
because Cassie told Lexi. and Lexi
told me. that the night of the party...

351
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.050
What?

352
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.140
Nothing.

353
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.350
Why do you keep staring at me?

354
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:29.270
I'm sorry.
Kind of spaced out for a second.

355
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.570
I wasn't being weird. was I?

356
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.990
No. You're being cute.

357
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.490
Listen. I don't want to sound corny
or whatever. but...

358
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.160
...you are literally the most
beautiful girl I've ever seen.

359
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.420
They hooked up.

360
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.130
Fuck.

361
00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.050
You always this wet?

362
00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.310
Kind of. It's super embarrassing.

363
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.150
- Does it turn you off?
- Not at all. It's cool.

364
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.150
Stay right here.

365
00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.090
Aah!

366
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.850
McKay. McKay. stop! Stop...

367
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.020
Now. I know this looks disturbing.
but for real.

368
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.310
I promise you.
this does not end in a rape.

369
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:53.730
But here's the thing. Everyone
on the planet watches porn. Fact.

370
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:57.990
And if you were to click on the 20 most
popular videos on Porn Hub right now.

371
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.070
this is basically what you'd see:

372
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.240
Good girl. yes. yes.

373
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.040
Are you gonna be
an obedient little slut?

374
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:11.210
- Say thank you. again.
- Oh. thank you.

375
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.500
I'm not trying to be sex negative
or anything. I'm just saying...

376
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.040
Stop!

377
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:16.750
...this shit isn't
out of left fucking field.

378
00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.340
- Fuck. McKay!
- What did I do?

379
00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.880
Why would you grab me like that?
I couldn't breathe.

380
00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:24.970
- I don't know. I thought you liked that.
- Why the fuck would I like that?

381
00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:27.890
Cassie. I'm sorry. I didn't know.

382
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:30.730
I just didn't expect it.

383
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.030
Cassie. I'm really sorry. okay?
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:45.530
You know I would never do anything
to hurt you.

385
00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.370
Just don't do it again.

386
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.750
Unless you ask me first.

387
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.510
Or I ask you.

388
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.140
Anyway. I didn't go to Lexi's.
That was a lie.

389
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.230
So. I was walking to McKay's party.

390
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.900
because I have this rule that
I don't drink and bike. 'cause like...

391
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.160
- Is that...?
- Oh. shit. Slow down.

392
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.120
Dude. that's Rue. Oh. my God.

393
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.330
- Wait. Didn't Rue. like. die?
- Oh. my God. I hate ghosts.

394
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.710
Yo. Casper! You want a ride?

395
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.760
Why. thank you.

396
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:25.590
- Ah. How old are you?
- 22.

397
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.510
Thanks.

398
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.890
Do you live in town?

399
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.640
No. I'm just. visiting my grandparents.

400
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:37.440
Hmm.

401
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.780
What about you?

402
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.110
Do you walk around like this?

403
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.660
What do you mean?

404
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.080
Well. this is how you look generally?

405
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.960
I mean... yeah.

406
00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.500
You're beautiful.

407
00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.630
Thank you.

408
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.810
I'm envious of your generation.
you know.

409
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.730
You guys don't care
as much about the rules.

410
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:21.020
You know. I think that's a good thing.

411
00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:24.690
And I don't want to be that old
guy that gives you advice.

412
00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:28.150
but I look at you
and I think there are...

413
00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.660
two versions
of how your life can go.

414
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.450
You can either go someplace.

415
00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:38.370
where you're wanted for who you are.

416
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:43.420
Or you can stay in a town like this.
End up like me.

417
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.130
Living your life out in motel rooms.

418
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.260
Selfishly...

419
00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.140
I hope you stay.

420
00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.940
Wider.

421
00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.730
Wider. There you go.

422
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.910
That's it. Good girl.

423
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.870
Jules once told me that
every night when she was a kid.

424
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.170
like. five or something...

425
00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.460
Spit.

426
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.380
...she'd lock herself
in the bathroom.

427
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.590
get down on her
hands and knees. and...

428
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.970
pray to God.

429
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.310
She'd pray that when she woke up
in the morning. she'd be 25 years old.

430
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.560
She'd live with her best friend. a girl.

431
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.280
Someone she hadn't met yet. but...

432
00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.950
someone she knew
she'd trust forever.

433
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.200
I don't know why.
but when she told me that story.

434
00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.830
I started to cry so hard
I hyperventilated.

435
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:07.380
You're so clean.
And you don't know how rare that is.

436
00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:15.510
Jules just kept laughing
and saying. "What's wrong?" But...

437
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.470
I didn't know.

438
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.260
And then. the night got weird.

439
00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.800
- Hey.
- Hey.

440
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.720
Now. there's a couple versions
of what happened that night.

441
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.020
It all depends on who you ask.
and to be honest.

442
00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.270
I'm not always
the most reliable narrator.

443
00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:33.440
But Nate was fucking on one.

444
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.110
And in turn.
Maddy was fucking on one.

445
00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.620
Hi.

446
00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.340
Get undressed.
I want to go swimming.

447
00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.650
- You're so hot.
- I know.

448
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.380
You're fucking crazy.

449
00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:42.840
No. I'm not. I'm just trying to get back
at my really shitty ex-boyfriend.

450
00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:44.550
What?

451
00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.850
What if I told you that I wanted you
to fuck me. right here. right now?

452
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:52.560
Are you serious?

453
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.570
And that's right about the time that
Jules decided to ghost her hookup

454
00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:59.150
and bike over to McKay's.

455
00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.660
Now. Jules texted Kat.
but Kat didn't answer. because...

456
00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:17.340
So what's the deal
with your friend. BB?

457
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:21.260
- What about her?
- Is she a prude. or is she a slut?

458
00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.340
Definitely a slut.

459
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.680
- What about you?
- What about me?

460
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.980
- Are you a slut?
- Yeah. I'm a fucking savage.

461
00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:36.360
- Oh. yeah? What's your number?
- Higher than you two can count.

462
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.860
Stop playing. You're a fucking prude.

463
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.820
Now. Kat wasn't a prude.
but she was a virgin.

464
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:46.410
She'd told Jules that a week into summer
school. and when Kat saw her reaction:

465
00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.290
Bitch. this isn't the '80s.
You need to catch a dick.

466
00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.880
She was on a mission to enter junior
year as a woman of questionable morals.

467
00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.750
Let me ask you a question.

468
00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.130
If I were to pull my dick out
right now. would you suck it?

469
00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.850
- I don't know. Let me see it.
- It's not hard yet.

470
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.680
You've probably never
sucked a dick in your life.

471
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:13.850
- Yeah. I have.
- Most girls don't know how to suck dick.

472
00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:16.350
- Yeah.
- What do you mean?

473
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.150
Well. they're too gentle.
It's like. they're fucking scared of it.

474
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:21.070
- Not in porn.
- Exactly.

475
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:23.820
- You watch porn?
- Doesn't everyone?

476
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.240
No. Every guy does. Yeah.

477
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.080
Not prudes. Only sluts.

478
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.410
- Yeah. well...
- Yeah. but like. how much?

479
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:36.040
- What?
- How much of a slut are you?

480
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.800
Mm. Why don't you come find out?

481
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.510
Why don't you take your top off?

482
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.220
Like. right now. in front of...
in front of these two?

483
00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.310
Yeah.

484
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:53.390
I dare you.

485
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:17.040
Yo. you know what they say. right?
Fat girls give the best head.

486
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.220
I was out back talking to Fezco
when Jules arrived.

487
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.060
What the fuck. Rue?

488
00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.640
What? What. what. what. what?

489
00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:42.190
Come on now. bruh.
You owe me 120 bucks.

490
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:47.360
- My bad. man. I forgot.
- Shit. you know I ain't trippin'.

491
00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.280
Well. to be honest with you.

492
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.580
your whole drug shit
got me feeling kind of uneasy.

493
00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.250
Come on. don't go soft on me. Fez.

494
00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.370
No. I'm not. It's just that...

495
00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.840
I like you.
And I missed you. bruh. Like...

496
00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:08.260
That shit at the beginning of summer
had me scared as fuck.

497
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:11.340
- Yeah. you and everybody else.
- I'm serious. Rue.

498
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:14.100
I've seen a lot of people die.

499
00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:18.020
None like you.

500
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:22.650
I don't know what type of fucked up shit
you got going inside your head.

501
00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:26.650
I don't know how to help.
but I could tell you one thing:

502
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.240
this drug shit. it's not the answer.

503
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:38.250
You know. I remember
when I was eleven years old...

504
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.330
It was a couple months
after my dad got diagnosed.

505
00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:45.250
and we got the results back
from the prognosis.

506
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.800
And it was really good.
It was like. 80/20.

507
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.720
And we decided to celebrate. so...

508
00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.510
we like ordered a bunch of Chinese food.

509
00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:00.350
I remember that night.
I was laying between my parents in bed.

510
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:02.020
and...

511
00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.530
all of a sudden I couldn't breathe.

512
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:13.360
It was like
there was no more air left in the world.

513
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:17.660
And I was gasping. and I was panicking.

514
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:21.040
And they called the ambulance
and they thought it was like...

515
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.500
an allergic reaction or some shit.

516
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:28.000
And then when I got to the hospital.

517
00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:30.300
they gave me liquid Valium.

518
00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.430
Yeah. To calm me down.

519
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.350
And when it hit me. I thought...

520
00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:45.650
This is it.

521
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.860
This is the feeling I have been
searching for my entire life.

522
00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.530
for as long as I could remember.

523
00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.570
Because suddenly...

524
00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.410
...the world went quiet.

525
00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:02.580
And I felt safe. in my own head.

526
00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.960
Two years later. he was gone.

527
00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.550
Panic attacks stayed.

528
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:19.680
And I found a way to live. so...

529
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.140
Will it eventually kill me? Maybe.

530
00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:25.150
Fuck. maybe not. I don't know.

531
00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:32.280
You still gonna be my dealer. Fez?

532
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.820
You a fucking trip. bruh.

533
00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:39.370
I'm too high to be having
this conversation right now.

534
00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.740
Yeah. man. Me. too.

535
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:44.460

- Are you okay?
- Yeah. It's fine.

582
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.640
Guess I knew

583
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.020
and I didn't want a fucking
broken cheekbone or some shit.

584
00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.480
Yeah. no.
